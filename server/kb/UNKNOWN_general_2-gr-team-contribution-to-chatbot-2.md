What is a passive house?
A passive house is a house that is characterised by great thermal comfort throughout the year, maintains constant temperatures in all areas of the house without humidity, has good ventilation and ensures very low to zero consumption. As a consequence, a passive house is a low-energy house.
What are the characteristics of a passive house?
The main characteristic of a passive house is its insulation. It employs high-quality thermal insulation to reduce heat loss by minimising thermal bridges. Also, a passive house is controlled by a ventilation system that causes airtightness. Conclusively, a passive house caters to humidity control, acoustic performance, fire protection and rodent proofing.
What is the thermal insulation of a passive house?
Thermal insulation is one of the critical characteristics that must be considered since the conception stage of a passive house. It employs materials such as cork, wood fibre, cellulose wadding, hemp, and straw to reduce heat loss by minimising the heat exchange between the outside and the inside environment.
What thermal insulation materials are used in a passive house?
There are three types of insulation materials used in a passive house:
Mineral insulation materials, such as glass wool and rock wool, which are generally fire-resistant.
Organic insulation materials produced from plant or animal materials, such as cork, wood fibre, cellulose wadding, hemp, and straw.
Synthetic insulation materials that come from fossil resources such as expanded polystyrene.
Where does the heat loss in a non-passive house come from?
What heat loss can a passive house avoid?
The majority of heat losses of an uninsulated building are coming through:
Attics and roof (30%)
Walls (25%)
Windows and glass (between 10 and 15%)
Ground (between 7 and 10%)
Thus, constructing a passive should cater to avoid heat losses to these spots.
How is a passive house constructed?
To construct a passive house, a building’s shell should be considered, i.e., all the elements that separate the interior from the exterior.
A passive house is constructed with continuous super-insulation around the building’s entire shell, insulating the slab, walls, windows and roof.
What is a thermal bridge?
A thermal bridge is an area which has higher thermal conductivity than the surrounding materials and creates a path of least resistance for heat transfer. In other words, a thermal bridge causes the heat exchange between the outside and the inside environment.
When thermal bridges appear in a passive house?
Thermal bridges appear when the continuous insulation of the shell, i.e. the external parts of a house, which are walls, windows, roof and slab, are broken.
This may be due to a change in the thermal transmittance of the materials or to the appearance of different constructive elements.
What are the consequences of thermal bridging in a passive house?
The consequences of thermal bridging in a passive house are:
Altering low interior surface temperatures. This can lead to moisture penetration and mould growth in building components in the worst case.
Altering high heat losses.
How does a passive house deal with thermal bridging?
A passive house must avoid thermal bridges to comply with the standards of being a passive house. It can be done with polyurethane to prevent thermal bridges and achieve optimal thermal insulation and airtightness. This is possible since it allows continuity of the insulating layer of the shell, avoiding thermal bridges and achieving airtightness.
What windows are appropriate for a passive house?
The triple-glazed windows are appropriate for a passive house. A triple-glazed window comprises three layers of glass set within a frame. Triple-glazed windows can offer a 35% reduction in heat loss compared to double-glazing. Triple-glazed windows generally cost 10-15% more than double-pane windows, but the improved energy efficiency can lead to long-term savings on heating and cooling bills.
How does air tightness affect a house?
Lack of airtightness results in air leakage and moisture that is carried through a house shell. The escaping warm air rises to condensation, mould, and ultimately rot house materials.
What are the advantages of a passive house?
Passive house buildings allow heating and cooling-related energy savings of up to 90% compared with typical building stock and over 75% compared with average new builds.
Is there a traditional passive house technique?
Cave houses apply the traditional passive house technique. In cave houses, thermal insulation is integrated. Cave houses are considered a sustainable housing typology as they are built using a construction type that utilises the thermal inertia of the land. For example, cave houses on Santorini island.
