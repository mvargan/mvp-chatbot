# HYDROPONICS – COMPLETE Q&A BASE (GREECE FOCUS)

==================================================
Q: What is Hydroponic gardening?
Q: What is Hydroponics?
==================================================

### Short
Hydroponics is growing plants without soil using water and nutrients.

### Full
Hydroponic gardening is a method of growing plants without soil. All nutrients that plants need are dissolved in water. The roots grow directly in nutrient-rich water instead of soil.

### Example
Plants can grow in water containers inside classrooms or greenhouses.

### Mini Task
Explain in one sentence how hydroponics is different from traditional farming.

--------------------------------------------------

==================================================
Q: Is Hydroponics sustainable?
Q: Why is hydroponic gardening sustainable?
==================================================

### Short
Yes. Hydroponics saves water, space and reduces pesticides.

### Full
Hydroponic gardening is considered sustainable because:
- It maximizes space (vertical farming possible).
- It uses up to 20 times less water than traditional farming.
- It reduces pesticide use (no soil diseases).
- It is not affected by weather (controlled microclimate).
- It requires less labour.
- It allows faster growth and higher production.

### Mini Task
Name two reasons why hydroponics is environmentally friendly.

--------------------------------------------------

==================================================
Q: Who should you consult for hydroponics?
Q: Who can help set up a hydroponic garden?
==================================================

### Short
An agricultural engineer specialized in hydroponics.

### Full
To set up a hydroponic system, you should consult an agricultural engineer who specializes in hydroponics. They understand nutrient systems, water control and plant growth optimization.

--------------------------------------------------

==================================================
Q: What materials are needed for hydroponics?
Q: What equipment do you need for hydroponics?
==================================================

### Short
Water containers, pump, plants, nutrients and LED lights.

### Full
To set up a hydroponic garden you need:
- Polystyrene boxes (water reservoirs)
- Water pump
- Micro plants
- Hydroponic combo meter (pH, temperature, conductivity, dissolved solids)
- LED grow light
- Cups or net pots
- Fertilizer with nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium and magnesium
- Water

### Mini Task
Why is measuring pH important in hydroponics?

--------------------------------------------------

==================================================
Q: What is the procedure for hydroponics?
Q: How do you set up a hydroponic garden?
==================================================

### Short
You prepare water, add nutrients, install pump and place plants.

### Full
Hydroponic gardening includes seven steps:

1. Fill polystyrene boxes with water (water reservoirs).
2. Measure pH (optimal range 5.5–6).
3. Add nutrients and check conductivity (level 8–9).
4. Install and turn on the water pump (oxygen supply).
5. Drill holes in cups (net pots).
6. Place micro plants so roots touch water.
7. Use LED grow lights to support growth.

### Mini Task
What would happen if the water pump stopped working?

--------------------------------------------------

==================================================
Q: Why is a water pump important in hydroponics?
==================================================

### Short
Plants need oxygen to grow.

### Full
In soil, roots get oxygen from air pockets. In hydroponics, roots are in water, so a pump is needed to supply oxygen. Without oxygen, plants cannot survive.

--------------------------------------------------

==================================================
Q: Why is fertilizer important in hydroponics?
==================================================

### Short
Plants need nutrients to grow.

### Full
Hydroponic plants do not grow in soil, so they must receive nutrients through water. Fertilizers provide essential elements such as magnesium, phosphorus and calcium that keep plants healthy and productive.

--------------------------------------------------

==================================================
Q: What should you do after setting up a hydroponic garden?
==================================================

### Short
Monitor water regularly.

### Full
After setting up the system, check water every three days. Measure pH and conductivity. Add water or nutrients if needed.

--------------------------------------------------

==================================================
Q: How fast do hydroponic plants grow?
Q: How can hydroponic plants grow faster?
==================================================

### Short
Hydroponic plants grow faster than traditional plants.

### Full
Hydroponic plants grow faster because nutrients are directly available in water. If more fertilizers are added, growth can increase further. However, organic hydroponic methods may lead to slower growth compared to nutrient-rich systems.

### Mini Task
What are the advantages and risks of adding too much fertilizer?

COUNTRY CONTEXT (GREECE)
==================================================

Hydroponics was discussed and demonstrated during project mobility in Greece. It connects engineering, sustainability and innovative agriculture.
