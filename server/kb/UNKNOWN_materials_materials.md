What is green energy?
Green energy is defined as the energy which comes from sources and is produced by methods that do not harm the natural environment
What are “green jobs”?
Jobs that contribute to preserving or restoring the environment and our planet are referred to as 'green jobs'
Can industries help address climate change?
Many industries are looking to adapt their products and processes to help tackle climate change, such as exploring the use of renewable energy or becoming more energy efficient.
Is there a demand for renewable energy jobs?
The population engaged in some type of global renewable energy is constantly growing.
How is the payment for green energy jobs?
Some of the highest paying jobs in green energy …….
What kind of green energy jobs are there in Greece?
There is a big variety of jobs that are involved in green energy, such as technical professionals like engineers, plumbers, electricians with the appropriate specialization can claim positions in the green energy field.
What skills are required for a career in renewable energy?
Knowledge: It is important to know how solar panels, wind turbines, and hydroelectric dams work, which are used to convert natural forces into energy.
Studies on the operation of solar panels, wind turbines, and hydroelectric dams are necessary.
Investigation of emerging technologies such as bioenergy, geothermal power, and tidal power, bioenergy, geothermal power, and tidal power are gaining ground.
Practical experience is valuable too. Practical projects, internships, or workshops can provide this.
Apart from studies and practical training, what other general skills are required for a career in renewable energy?
Software skills are increasingly important. We need to learn how to use tools for energy analysis and simulation and more.
Innovation and creativity are at the heart of renewable energy. Such skills enable the development of solutions that are not only technologically advanced but also sustainable and cost-effective.
Project Management skills: Organizational skills are important for effective project management.
Sound planning skills, setting clear goals and timelines are essential, as is the ability to identify required resources, from materials to human resources
Communication skills are another vital aspect. This is crucial when dealing with diverse teams and stakeholders. Teamwork thrives when communication channels are open and respectful.
How will the green energy affect our future?
Green energy is going to be part of the future of the world, offering a cleaner alternative to many of today’s energy sources. These energy sources are not just good for the environment, but are also leading to job creation and look set to become economically viable as developments continue. New opportunities are emerging in the green energy market and if we acquire the right skills we could be co-creators of a better future.

In Greece there is an increasing progress in innovation in terms of green energy.
What is the current situation in the employment of women in green energy innovation positions in Greece?
Nowadays, in Greece, more and more women are occupied in important possessions in the green energy sector, in both the research and industry.
Is there a famous Greek who has contributed to green energy?
Archimedes of Syracuse (c. 287 – c. 212 BC) was a famous Greek who has contributed to green energy. He was an Ancient Greek mathematician, physicist, engineer, astronomer, and inventor. Although few details of his life are known, he is regarded as one of the leading scientists in classical antiquity. As legend has it, Archimedes arranged mirrors as a parabolic reflector and managed to burn the attacking Roman ships using solar energy.

How was the parabolic reflector invented by Archimedes and how is it applicable today?
As legend has it, Archimedes arranged mirrors as a parabolic reflector and managed to burn the attacking Roman ships using solar energy. Nowadays parabolic reflectors are used to collect energy from a distant source (for example sound waves or incoming star light), and also in simple everyday uses.
What is known about the first electric car which was produced in Greece ?
Another pioneer, although unknown, we could refer, is the first electric car, all over the world. This is the ENFIELD and it was built in Syros, a Greek island, not in a car factory but in a shipyard by workers skilled in building ships. Kostantinos Adraktas, director of Enfield Automotive, designed and built an electric two-seater microcar with lead-acid batteries. The car had an 8.2 hp electric motor, a top speed of 80 kilometers per hour and a range of 80 kilometers. Its length was only 2.7 meters. The political and economic conditions in Greece and the world at the time did not allow the production to be licensed. Only 112 units were manufactured
