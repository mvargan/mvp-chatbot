What is Hydroponic gardening?
What is Hydroponics?
Hydroponic Gardening involves growing plants without soil. All the nutrients a plant needs are provided through water.
Is Hydroponics sustainable?
Why hydroponic gardening is sustainable?
Hydroponic Gardening is Sustainable Agriculture for the following reasons:
It maximizes space as soil is not needed and vertical farming may be applied.
It uses 20 times less water than conventional agriculture.
It uses less pesticides as there are no soil-growing diseases.
It is unaffected by weather conditions as technical microclimate is applied.
It needs less labour to set up and maintain
It achieves faster plant growth and higher production.
Who to consult regarding hydroponics?
Who can help set up a hydroponic garden?
An agricultural engineer specialising in hydroponics is the engineer you should consult for setting up a hydroponic garden.
What materials are needed to set up a hydroponic garden?
What equipment do you need for hydroponics?
The following materials are required to set up a hydroponic garden::
polystyrene boxes
water pump
Micro plants
Hydroponic combo meter for pH, Temperature, Conductivity, and Dissolved solids.
LED grow light.
Cups or net pots.
Fertilizer including 5 key nutrients: nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, calcium, and magnesium.
Water.
What procedure do you follow for hydroponics?
How do you set up a hydroponic garden?
The Hydroponic Gardening procedure includes seven steps:
The first step is filling in the polystyrene boxes with water to use them as water reservoirs.
The second step is to measure the water pH using the hydroponic combo meter, to ensure the pH optimal range for hydroponics between 5.5 and 6
The third step involves adding hydroponic nutrients to the water and measuring its conductivity. Using the hydroponic combo meter you should ensure its level between 8 and 9 indicating that there are enough fertilizers.
The fourth step is to adjust the water pump in the water reservoirs and turn it on. Notably, the water pump is very important as it provides oxygen to plant roots.
The fifth step is to drill holes in the cups to use them as pots allowing plant roots to come out
The sixth step is to fix the micro plants in the pots and place them in the water reservoirs so that plant roots are in the water.
The seventh step involves using LED grow lights to advance the plants’ growth
Why using a water pump is important in hydroponics?
Why use water pumps in hydroponic gardens?
The plants need oxygen to grow! In traditional farming, roots can get the oxygen needed for respiration from pockets of air in the soil. Οn a hydroponic setup, you need to oxygenate your container by installing an air pump.
Why fertilizer is important in hydroponics?
Why use fertilizer in a hydroponic garden?
Just like plants growing in the soil need healthy soil and nutrients, hydroponic plants also need nutrients. Plants need plenty of magnesium, phosphorus, calcium, and other nutrients to stay healthy and productive.  For this reason, fertilizers should be added to the water containers of hydroponic gardens.
What to do after setting up a hydroponic garden?
After setting up a Hydroponic Garden, it is important to monitor it. Every three days check the water for pH and conductivity. Add water or nutrients if necessary.
How fast do hydroponic plants grow?
How can hydroponic plants grow fast?
Following an organic hydroponic procedure entails having the plants grow slower. In case you want the plants to grow faster then you should add more fertilizers in the water.
