# PASSIVE HOUSE – GREECE CONTEXT (COMPLETE Q&A BASE)

==================================================
Q: What is a passive house?
==================================================

### Short
A passive house is a low-energy house with high comfort.

### Full
A passive house is a building designed to maintain thermal comfort all year round. It keeps constant indoor temperatures, prevents humidity problems, ensures good ventilation and consumes very little to zero energy. It is considered a low-energy house.

### Mini Task
Why do you think constant indoor temperature is important?

--------------------------------------------------

==================================================
Q: What are the characteristics of a passive house?
==================================================

### Short
High insulation and airtight construction.

### Full
Main characteristics include:
- High-quality thermal insulation
- Minimization of thermal bridges
- Airtight building shell
- Controlled ventilation system
- Humidity control
- Acoustic performance
- Fire protection
- Rodent protection

--------------------------------------------------

==================================================
Q: What is thermal insulation in a passive house?
==================================================

### Short
It reduces heat loss between inside and outside.

### Full
Thermal insulation is essential from the design stage. It reduces heat exchange between indoor and outdoor environments. Materials include cork, wood fibre, cellulose wadding, hemp and straw.

--------------------------------------------------

==================================================
Q: What insulation materials are used in a passive house?
==================================================

### Short
Mineral, organic and synthetic materials.

### Full
Three main types:

1. Mineral insulation
Glass wool and rock wool (fire-resistant).

2. Organic insulation
Cork, wood fibre, cellulose, hemp and straw.

3. Synthetic insulation
Expanded polystyrene (from fossil resources).

--------------------------------------------------

==================================================
Q: Where does heat loss occur in a non-passive house?
==================================================

### Short
Mainly through roof, walls and windows.

### Full
Heat loss in uninsulated buildings:
- Roof/attic: 30%
- Walls: 25%
- Windows: 10–15%
- Ground: 7–10%

Passive houses are designed to minimize these losses.

### Mini Task
Which part of a house loses the most heat?

--------------------------------------------------

==================================================
Q: How is a passive house constructed?
==================================================

### Short
With continuous super-insulation around the shell.

### Full
The building shell (walls, roof, slab, windows) is continuously insulated. Super-insulation surrounds the entire structure to prevent heat loss and maintain airtightness.

--------------------------------------------------

==================================================
Q: What is a thermal bridge?
==================================================

### Short
A point where heat escapes easily.

### Full
A thermal bridge is an area with higher thermal conductivity that allows heat to transfer more easily between inside and outside.

--------------------------------------------------

==================================================
Q: When do thermal bridges appear?
==================================================

### Short
When insulation is interrupted.

### Full
Thermal bridges appear when continuous insulation is broken. This may happen due to material changes or structural elements interrupting the insulating layer.

--------------------------------------------------

==================================================
Q: What are the consequences of thermal bridging?
==================================================

### Short
Heat loss and moisture problems.

### Full
Consequences include:
- Lower interior surface temperatures
- Moisture penetration
- Mold growth
- Increased heat loss

--------------------------------------------------

==================================================
Q: How does a passive house avoid thermal bridges?
==================================================

### Short
By maintaining continuous insulation.

### Full
Thermal bridges are avoided by ensuring continuous insulation around the shell. Materials like polyurethane help maintain airtightness and insulation continuity.

--------------------------------------------------

==================================================
Q: What windows are appropriate for a passive house?
==================================================

### Short
Triple-glazed windows.

### Full
Triple-glazed windows have three glass layers. They reduce heat loss by about 35% compared to double glazing. Although they cost 10–15% more, they provide long-term energy savings.

--------------------------------------------------

==================================================
Q: How does airtightness affect a house?
==================================================

### Short
It prevents air leakage and moisture damage.

### Full
Poor airtightness leads to warm air escaping, condensation, mold and structural damage. Proper airtightness improves energy efficiency and building durability.

--------------------------------------------------

==================================================
Q: What are the advantages of a passive house?
==================================================

### Short
Up to 90% energy savings.

### Full
Passive houses reduce heating and cooling energy use by up to 90% compared to older buildings and over 75% compared to typical new buildings.

--------------------------------------------------

==================================================
Q: Is there a traditional passive house technique?
==================================================

### Short
Yes, cave houses.

### Full
Cave houses are traditional examples of passive design. They use the thermal inertia of the earth for insulation. For example, cave houses in Santorini, Greece, maintain stable temperatures naturally.

--------------------------------------------------

==================================================
COUNTRY CONTEXT (GREECE)
==================================================

Passive house principles and traditional cave housing were discussed in connection with Greece, especially referencing Santorini as an example of natural passive design.
