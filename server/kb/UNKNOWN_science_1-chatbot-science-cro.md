What is the role of conservation science?
Conservation science ensures protection and maintenance of natural environments to ensure their existence.
What jobs are connected to conservation science?
Botanist, conservation and recourse forester, marine biologist, zoologist, ranger are jobs connected to conservation science.
What does a botanist do?
A botanist is a scientist who studies plants, such as algae, conifers and ferns. They study many areas of plants, including their genetics, physical structures and distribution. Many botanists specialize in an area of botany, such as ecology, which is the study of the relationship between plants and their environment.

A forest conservation is the practice of planning and maintaining forested areas for the benefit and sustainability of future generations. Forest conservation involves the upkeep of the natural resources within a forest that are beneficial for both humans and the ecosystem.
What does a marine biologist do?
A marine biologist studies biological oceanography and the associated fields of chemical, physical, and geological oceanography to understand marine organisms. Depending on his area of work, his duties as a marine biologist could include: conducting species inventories, testing and monitoring sea creatures exposed to pollutants. collecting samples and data-using processes such as coring techniques, geographic information systems (GIS), visual recording and sampling.
What does a zoologist do?
A zoologist specializes in the scientific examination of animals, encompassing their behavior, physiology, classification, and distribution. A zoologist studies the behaviours, functions, natural environments and ecology of animals.
What is a zoology?
Zoology is an area of biology that studies animal life. The purpose of zoology is to expand scientific knowledge and utilise it in wildlife management, conservation, agriculture and medicine.
What does a ranger do?
A ranger patrols protected areas, monitor wildlife, prevent poaching, engage local communities in conservation, help communities resolve human-wildlife conflicts, and assist with tourism.
