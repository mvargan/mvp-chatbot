==================================================
Q: Where was the term "passive house" invented?
==================================================

### Short
Germany.

### Full
The concept of the passive house was first developed in Germany as a building standard focused on ultra-low energy consumption.

--------------------------------------------------

==================================================
Q: What is the primary goal of a passive house?
==================================================

### Short
Ultra-low energy consumption.

### Full
The primary goal is to drastically reduce heating and cooling energy demand, lowering the building’s ecological footprint.

--------------------------------------------------

==================================================
Q: What are the key principles of passive house design?
==================================================

### Short
Insulation, airtightness and heat recovery.

### Full
Key principles include:
- High insulation levels
- Airtight construction
- High-performance windows
- Heat recovery ventilation
- Minimizing thermal bridges

--------------------------------------------------

==================================================
Q: What is the maximum annual heating demand?
==================================================

### Short
15 kWh per square meter per year.

### Full
A certified passive house must not exceed 15 kWh of heating demand per square meter of living space annually.

--------------------------------------------------

==================================================
Q: How does a passive house maintain indoor air quality?
==================================================

### Short
With heat recovery ventilation.
