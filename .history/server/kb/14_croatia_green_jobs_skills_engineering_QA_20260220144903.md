==================================================
GREEN ENGINEERING
==================================================

==================================================
Q: What is an example of green engineering?
==================================================

### Short
A passive house (Passivhaus).

### Full
A Passivhaus is a strong example of green engineering because:
- It consumes far less energy than conventional houses
- High thermal insulation prevents heat loss in winter
- It reduces heat gain in summer
- It can approach near-zero environmental impact

Increasing the construction of passive houses supports sustainable development.

--------------------------------------------------

==================================================
Q: What materials are used in a passive house?
==================================================

### Short
Sustainable and eco-friendly materials.

### Full
Passive houses use materials such as:
- Bio-based spray foam insulation
- Closed panel timber frames
- Engineered and recycled lumber
- Low-VOC eco-friendly paints
- Energy-efficient lighting (e.g., fluorescent bulbs)
- Sustainable window and door systems

These materials reduce environmental impact and improve energy efficiency.

--------------------------------------------------

==================================================
Q: How is engineering adapting to sustainability demands?
==================================================

### Short
By integrating green technologies and circular principles.

### Full
Engineering increasingly incorporates:
- Energy-efficient design
- Renewable energy systems
- Sustainable materials
- Circular economy principles
- Low-carbon technologies
- Waste minimization
- Innovation in water and transportation systems

--------------------------------------------------

==================================================
Q: What green skills are essential for renewable energy engineers?
==================================================

### Short
