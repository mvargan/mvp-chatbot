# CONSERVATION SCIENCE – COMPLETE Q&A BASE

==================================================
Q: What is the role of conservation science?
==================================================

### Short
Conservation science protects and maintains natural environments.

### Full
Conservation science ensures the protection and maintenance of forests, oceans, wildlife and ecosystems. Its goal is to prevent environmental degradation and ensure that natural environments continue to exist for future generations.

### Mini Task
Name one natural environment in your country that needs protection.

--------------------------------------------------

==================================================
Q: What jobs are connected to conservation science?
==================================================

### Short
Botanist, conservation forester, marine biologist, zoologist and ranger.

### Full
Jobs connected to conservation science include botanists who study plants, conservation foresters who protect forests, marine biologists who study ocean life, zoologists who research animals, and rangers who patrol and protect natural areas.

### Mini Task
Choose one job and explain how it helps the environment.

--------------------------------------------------

==================================================
Q: What does a botanist do?
==================================================

### Short
A botanist studies plants.

### Full
A botanist is a scientist who studies plants such as algae, conifers and ferns. They study plant genetics, physical structures, distribution and ecology. Many botanists specialize in ecology, which focuses on how plants interact with their environment.

### Example
A botanist may study how climate change affects forest plant species.

--------------------------------------------------

==================================================
Q: What does a conservation and resource forester do?
==================================================

### Short
They protect and manage forests.

### Full
Conservation scientists and foresters evaluate forest and soil quality. They assess damage caused by fires or logging activities. They also lead forest protection activities such as fire suppression and planting seedlings to restore damaged areas.

### Example
After a forest fire, a forester helps replant trees.

--------------------------------------------------

==================================================
Q: What is the meaning of forest conservation?
==================================================

### Short
Forest conservation protects forests for future generations.

### Full
Forest conservation is the practice of planning and maintaining forested areas to ensure sustainability. It protects natural resources in forests that are important for humans and ecosystems.

### Mini Task
Why are forests important for climate stability?

--------------------------------------------------

==================================================
Q: What does a marine biologist do?
==================================================

### Short
A marine biologist studies ocean life.

### Full
A marine biologist studies marine organisms and biological oceanography. They may conduct species inventories, monitor sea creatures exposed to pollutants, collect samples, and use tools like GIS, coring techniques and visual recordings to analyze marine ecosystems.

### Example
A marine biologist may research how plastic pollution affects sea turtles.

--------------------------------------------------

==================================================
Q: What does a zoologist do?
==================================================

### Short
A zoologist studies animals and their behaviour.

### Full
A zoologist examines animals, including their behaviour, physiology, classification and distribution. They study animal ecology and natural environments to support conservation and wildlife protection.

### Example
A zoologist may monitor endangered animal populations.

--------------------------------------------------

==================================================
Q: What is zoology?
==================================================

### Short
Zoology is the science of animal life.

### Full
Zoology is a branch of biology that studies animals. It expands scientific knowledge about animal behaviour, physiology and ecosystems. Zoology supports wildlife management, conservation, agriculture and medicine.

### Mini Task
Name one animal species that zoologists help protect.

--------------------------------------------------

==================================================
Q: What does a ranger do?
==================================================

### Short
A ranger protects wildlife and natural parks.

### Full
A ranger patrols protected areas, monitors wildlife, prevents poaching, works with local communities, resolves human-wildlife conflicts and assists with eco-tourism.

### Example
A ranger may stop illegal hunting in a national park.
